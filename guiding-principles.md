# Principle Values
Our Guiding Principles describe what's important to us, things we value. They
guide us in our daily work and when decisions have to be made. To bring these
values to life we define more concrete Engineering Principles and apply them.
Nonetheless they should of course also be respected in any situation that is not
covered by the principles.
## Always code. Always
Everything designed being infrastructure or application is constructed from code.
This drives reuse, improved deployment activities and commonality.
## Source Code Management is used for all code-bases
All this code needs to be stored with distributed access.
This enables developers to contribute to projects effectively.
## Design for failure
Every IT solution will fail, at some point. To reduce the impact of this, design for failure.
## Cloud-Native by default
With a vast choice of tooling available cut through the complexity with a default choice.
Often the native tooling available to use is a great start.
## Be an entrepreneur
Driving innovation drives the most interesting solutions and attracts the best talent.
## Keep it simple, stupid
Simple is best for implementing a Minimal Viable Product by reducing design and implementation complexity.
## Automation is key
Automation is a primary driver to delivering a reliable, scalable and secure solution.
## Give back to the community
Run technical talks, contribute to open source projects and support fellow teammates.
## Commonality drives reuse
Identify repeating code, consolidate into a shared common library.
## Enjoy and have fun!
