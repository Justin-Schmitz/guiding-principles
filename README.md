# Fujitsu Cloud Native Services Engineering Values and Principles
## About
Welcome to v1 of the Cloud Native Services Engineering Values and Principles.
The motivation for documenting our values and principles is to have a common
understanding of what is important in how we approach engineering within Fujitsu.
Aside from this readme, there is a growing number of documents outlining our principles:
 1. [Guiding Principles](guiding-principles.md). These are high level
    statements of what we value across Fujitsu engineering.
Within these documents, there is no intentional ordering for the purposes of
emphasis or priority. You should read each value and principle as being of equal
value to those above and below.
## Changes
All changes will be recorded here.
## How to interact
These documents contain contributions from across all levels of Fujitsu. We'd like to continue maintaining them in that way so...
 * If you have a question, create an issue.
 * If you have a suggestion, create a pull request.
Issues and pull requests will be reviewed by the Senior CLoud Native Technologists in the Cloud Native Services team, who are responsible for keeping this up to date,
and you'll get feedback. Too easy!
